	{CDEK is a database and web-platform to enable researchers and analysts to study all active pharmaceutical ingredients with evidence of clinical experience in humans. CDEK contains over 20,000 active pharmaceutical ingredients with surrounding annotated metadata (i.e. sponsoring organizations, indications, clinical trial data, chemical structure, etc). We curated CDEK in part by disambiguating intervention and organization names from ClinicalTrials.gov. This information was cross-referenced against entries in prominent international drug databases (e.g. PubChem, ChEMBL, DrugBank).}
